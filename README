This is a tutorial project for SBT Intro lecture.

As you might have noticed, there is no lesson-one project. The first exercise is to create a simple lesson-one project
using Typesafe Activator yourself.

The instructions for the following exercises are inside the README files of each of the subprojects o this project. Enjoy!


Lesson One: Creating new projects

Create a simple SBT Scala project unsing either "activator new" or "activator ui".
